# MACChanger
MACChanger is a shell script for generating a random MAC address using
a handful of common vendor octets and replacing the MAC address on a
specified interface (generally I use en0).

This script was developed for **macOS/OSX**. I believe it will also
work on BSD derived OSes such as **FreeBSD**.

Requires both `sed` and `awk` (which you most likely have).
